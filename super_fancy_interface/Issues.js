// Make the menu more like menu.
// More than an order.
// Send the order only once.
// When aan order is sent while the client isn't online (has his interface opened),
// he wont recive the order
// even when he opens his after it and refreshes.
// @user, send a notification to the user when the server restarts to re-order.
// @Client, removeOrder is to be fixed
// Store the user's order in the db, store the [date, username, items orderes
// WTF is splice doing??
// Doesn't show the username  in the menu after being redirected from signup.
// Really need to limit the to an order/user.
